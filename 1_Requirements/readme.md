Introduction:
  
The vehicle Seat heat monitoring system is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats.In this project for activity1 we use button sensor and the temperature sensor.The button sensor is used to sense whether the driver or passenger is seated or not.The temperature sensor is used to sense the temperature.In activity2 the temperature request is sent to heater for controlling the according to the enviroment in cool places.In activity3 the increasing or decreasing temperature will displayed in PWM.

Features:

This will sense whether the driver or passenger seated or not.

This is user friendly system.

Strengths:

This system can alter the temperature according to the environmental conditions

WHAT:

This is the seat temperature monitoring system.

WHERE:

This can used in automotive industries.

WHEN:
 
This can used in low temperature areas.

WHY:

This can be used for preventing health issues in low temperature areas.

HOW:

This can alter the temperature by generating heat through heater.
